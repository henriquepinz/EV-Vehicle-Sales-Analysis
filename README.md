# EV Vehicles Sales Analysis
###### This is a portfolio project based on a dataset provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA) under a CC license. 

Conducted analysis in Python to surface insights on sales trends and patterns in a dataset containing more than 3 million records. Worked independently to investigate and analyze data in Python and built a performance dashboard in Microsoft PowerBI to visualize trends related to sales numbers, powertrain distribution, charger type and availability, across the span of 13 years (2010-2023).

### Global Sales Analysis

Global sales began rising between 2016 and 2018. Starting in 2019 they spiked and have been maintaining this trend.

### Sales by region

Here is a visualization of the top adopters by region. The Chinese market leads by a large margin, although Europe caught up and even surpassed the Asian superpower in 2020, the Chinese sales have been in exponential growth ever since — likely driven by subsidies by the Chinese government $^1$ .
Starting in 2018 the European market has distanced itself from the American market as well, assuming a leading position in the western world in the adoption of electric vehicles.

### Powertrain Market Distribution

Electric vehicles with batteries (BEV) represent 67% of the global market, while plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and Hydrogen (FCEV) represent 32% and 0,14% respectively.

### Sales Amount & Energy Demand

As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) grows worldwide, their electricity consumption is expected to rise significantly. In 2023, the global EV fleet used approximately 130 TWh of electricity, which is similar to Norway's total electricity consumption for that year. On a global scale, EVs made up about 0.5% of the world’s total final electricity use in 2023, with China and Europe each accounting for around 1%. The impact of various EV types on electricity demand differs by region. For instance, in China, electric two-wheelers and buses together 
made up nearly 30% of EV electricity consumption in 2023, while in the United States, electric cars alone accounted for more than 95% of EV electricity demand.

### Market distribution of vehicle type

Not surprisingly, cars represent the vast majority of ev vehicles in the streets. The only other category putting up is Vans, even tough they gradually lost their market share, they have been making a comeback.

### Public Charging Stations

Public charging infrastructure and its interoperability are essential for increasing widespread EV adoption and ensuring equitable access. The number of public chargers grew by over 40% in 2023, with fast chargers expanding by 55%, surpassing the growth of slower chargers. By the end of 2023, fast chargers accounted for over 35% of the total public charging network.

China is the global leader in electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) deployment, controlling more than 85% of fast chargers and around 60% of slow chargers. With electric vehicle sales surpassing 35%, exceeding their 2025 target, China is now focusing on expanding charging infrastructure $^2$ . Their goal is to achieve full coverage in cities and along highways by 2030, as well as broaden access in rural areas. Additionally, China is promoting sustainable charging habits, aiming for 60% of EV charging to occur during off-peak hours by 2025, starting with five pilot cities.

### Dashboard and Final Thoughts

Electric car sales continue to rise and could reach approximately 17 million in 2024, making up more than one in five cars sold globally. Electric vehicles are progressing towards becoming a mainstream product in more countries. Despite concerns about the industry's growth due to tight profit margins, fluctuating battery metal prices, high inflation, and the reduction of purchase incentives in some regions, global sales remain strong. In the first quarter of 2024, electric car sales grew by around 25% compared to the same period in 2023, mirroring the growth seen in early 2022.

The global number of installed public charging stations increased by 40% in 2023 compared to 2022, with fast charger growth outpacing that of slower chargers. In key EV markets, the installation of charging points is progressing quickly due to targeted policies. To facilitate a widespread transition to electric transportation and support longer trips, broad and affordable access to public charging infrastructure will be essential, even though most charging will still take place privately at homes and workplaces.
